```

**Value Stacking:**
```
What you get with Family Plan:

Individual tracking: $24/mo × 5 = $120/mo
Family dashboard: Priceless
Duplicate detection: Saves $15-30/mo
Bundle recommendations: Saves $20-40/mo

Total value: $150-190/mo

## 📱 Mobile App Pricing

### Challenge: App Store Fees
- Apple/Google take 30% first year, 15% after
- Need to account for this in pricing

### Solution 1: Absorb Fees (Recommended)
Keep same pricing, eat the fees:
- **Why:** Simpler for users, competitive pricing
- **Trade-off:** Lower margins, but higher conversions

### Solution 2: Increase Mobile Prices
Adjust prices to account for fees:
- Basic: $17/mo (nets $12 after 30% fee)
- Pro: $34/mo (nets $24)
- Family: $56/mo (nets $39)
- Business: $84/mo (nets $59)

**Problem:** Users will notice and go to web instead

### Solution 3: Encourage Web Signup
- Offer web signup with app access (no fees)
- "Sign up on web and save 30%"
- Use app for tracking, web for billing

**Recommended:** Solution 1 (absorb fees) or Solution 3 (web signup)
